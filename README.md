# Motivation

During my preparation for OSCP I have noticed that there are plenty of guides but not all of them provide clear steps for solivng the problem.

So I have decided to write this OSCP Cook Book to help takle all possible problems that you may encounter during the exam.

## How-To

1. Read the cheat sheets to understand the problem and find a solution: https://github.com/jonnyzar/OSCP_Tools/tree/main/Cheat_Sheets
2. Use tools 
3. Contribute to this repository if you have a better tool

### Web 

The web part within this cheatsheet exceeds the needs of the OSCP exam but is beneficial for any Bug Bounty hunting. But I leave it to you to figure out what is needed and what is not.

## Warning

Please do not try to submit any malicious tools. This is going to be checked and prosecuted.

## Discalimer

Use at your own risk and only on your own equipment that would not cause harm to your surroundings.

Author of this tools rejects any responsibility for any harm caused by inappopriate use of these tools.
